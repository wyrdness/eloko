These malevolent forest entities appear as small humanoid creatures covered in grass or leaves, adorned with bells that produce hypnotic sounds, and possessing long, sharp claws and the ability to swallow victims whole by opening their mouths to extraordinary proportions. The Biloko are said to inhabit the deepest parts of the Congo Basin rainforest, serving as supernatural guardians of the forest who attack hunters, travelers, and anyone who ventures too far into their domain. These spirits embody the very real dangers of the rainforest while reinforcing cultural taboos about respecting nature and the boundaries between human settlements and wild spaces."
